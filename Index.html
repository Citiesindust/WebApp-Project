                <h3>The Human Element: Phishing</h3>
                <h4>Phishing</h4>
                <p>
                   Phishing is a type of fraud. It is an attempt to trick people. Emails, messages, or calls. They look real.
                   But they are not. They are dangerous. They are a threat to your security. Always be suspicious. Don't trust
                   anything. Be vigilant. Look for clues. Check the sender. Check the links. Check the attachments. If in doubt,
                   delete. Don't take chances. It's not worth it. Remember: Prevention is key. Stay alert, stay informed,
                   and stay safe.

                <h3>Held Hostage by Ransomware</h3>
                <h4>Ransomware</h4>
                <p>
                    Ransomware is a type of malware. It encrypts files and demands ransom. People pay. Attackers profit.
                    It is a game of cat and mouse. A race between attacker and defender. Stay alert, stay vigilant, or risk
                    falling prey. Prevention is key. Keep your software up to date. Use strong passwords. Back up your data.
                    If you do fall victim, act fast. Disconnect. Assess. Don't pay. It's a gamble, with no guarantee of success.
                    The only sure bet is to stay informed, stay up to date, and stay safe.
